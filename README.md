# Marine Heatwaves Hotspots within Tañon Strait Protected Seascape (TSPS)

This repository hosts maps depicting the hotspots of various metrics of marine heatwaves within the Tañon Strait Protected Seascape (TSPS).

## Description

| Metrics              | Description                               | Image Filename |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------|
| Duration             | Total days or period of a MHW occurrence  | duration.png   |
| Frequency            | Number of MHW events in a year            | frequency.png  |
| Cumulative Intensity | Sum of the daily anomalies during an MHW  | icum.png       |
| Maximum Intensity    | Maximum temperature anomaly during an MHW | imax.png       |
| Mean Intensity       | Mean temperature anomaly during an MHW    | imean.png      |

## Limitations

The analysis is based on the sea surface temperature anomalies that are more than the 90th percentile of the mean climatology from January 1, 2003 to August 31, 2023 . Values were re-gridded through spline interpolation.

## Data Source

The analysis used the daily Multi-scale Ultra-high Resolution Sea Surface Temperature dataset from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration covering the period January 1, 2003 to August 31, 2023 with 0.001° x 0.001° spatial resolution.
