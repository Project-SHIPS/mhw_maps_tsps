# Marine Heatwaves Hotspots within Tañon Strait Protected Seascape (TSPS)

This repository hosts maps depicting the hotspots of various metrics of marine heatwaves within the Tañon Strait Protected Seascape (TSPS).

## Description

| Metrics              | Description                               | Image Filename |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Duration             | Total days or period of a MHW occurrence  | duration.png   |
| Frequency            | Number of MHW events in a year            | frequency.png  |
| Cumulative Intensity | Sum of the daily anomalies during an MHW  | icum.png       |
| Maximum Intensity    | Maximum temperature anomaly during an MHW | imax.png       |
| Mean Intensity       | Mean temperature anomaly during an MHW    | imean.png      |

## Limitations

The analysis is based on the sea surface temperature anomalies that are more than the 90th percentile of the mean climatology from January 1, 1982 to December 31, 2011. Values were re-gridded through spline interpolation.

## Data Source

This analysis used the daily Global Ocean OSTIA Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Reprocessed dataset from the Copernicus Marine Service covering the period January 1, 1982 to December 31, 2021 with 0.05 deg x 0.05 deg spatial resolution.
